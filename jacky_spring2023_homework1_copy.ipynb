        "You might wonder why random projection works. The intuition is that random project perseves relative distance between any pair of points (i.e., a pair of points that are closed in high dimension remain close in lower dimension). This idea is formally stated by [Johnson–Lindenstrauss lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Lindenstrauss_lemma). One can use fancier algorithmic tools such as PCA, SVD or t-SNE to do this projection which you can check them in your own time. It is worth emphasicizing that none of these random projections are perfect -- projection from high-dimensions is fundamentally a losssy process. "
